# Welcome
JCP (Jay-see-p) Is a clone of Etsy where people come together to make, sell, buy, and collect unique items.

This is a recreation of the website Etsy entirely out of CSS, HTML, Javascript, React.js, and Redux.js for the frontend; PostreSQL and Ruby on rails for the backend. Its primary purpose is as a proof of concept.

# Technologies
* PostgreSQL
* Javascript
* React
* Redux
* Node
* Ruby on Rails
* jQuery
* jBuilder
* HTML & CSS
* Webpack
* Python

The frontend primarily uses the React framework and Redux architecture. Its contents are 
fetched from a Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL API using jQuery and jBuilder. Items were generated
using Python's requests for API and webscraping to be saved on PostgreSQL.

# Features

## Cart
Once logged in, navigate to a product and click 'Add to cart'. Products sent to
the cart are located in your cart page. The icon is located at the top right 
corner of the screen. You'll know when an item is added to your cart if a
notification below prompts you about the status of the item.
