Standing at 7.5 inches it is almost comparable to the size of a real skull. When creating this my priority was keeping the anatomy of the skull untouched while providing ample storage on the inside of the head. \n\nIn my pictures above I&#39;ve fit a commander deck of 100 cards with sleeves. Need more space? The jaw is hinged and can fit any dice or tokens you need! \n\n10 powerful magnets (8 for the head, 2 for the jaw) secure everything when closed, you can even carry it by the lid with no issues! That is if you have big hands- I recommend carrying it from the bottom side.\n\nThis is one of my favorite 3D projects to date and I have loved every second of the creation process. The skull is 3d printed in silver PLA. You can expect to see some minor rough patches on the undersides where supports were holding the pieces during the 3D print. Layer lines, or small grooves, are also to be expected in this kind of process. I personally think they look cool.  \n\nCurrently I am only printing in Silver, more colors and finishes will be introduced in the future.\n\nIf you have any requests or questions or custom requests please reach out to me and I&#39;ll get back to you as soon as I can!')

Rainbow moonstone is believed to help strengthen\nintuition and psychic perception, especially offering us visions of things that aren&#39;t immediately obvious.\nPhysically, it is said that Moonstone can promote conception by aiding all aspects of the reproductive system.\nMany women like Moonstone for its ability to balance hormonal and menstrual cycles. Moonstone is also known to \nhelp with the digestive system, including the liver, and can aid in the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals.\n\nTip: Charge your Moonstone by placing it on a windowsill or outdoors overnight during the full moon. You may notice the stone getting more powerful as the moon reaches its fullest point, and losing its potency as the moon wanes.\n\nAll uniqe products :) lots of love')

As a healer I must not contradict advice given by your doctor and advise you to see one if you have not done so. Healing sessions work optimally if the client books several sessions for us to work together. You are under no obligation to continue the sessions, but please let me know if you decide not to continue ~ as being a healer, I do genuinely care for you. \nHere you can book one session at a time, and elsewhere you can book a six, or twelve week group of sessions. These can be arranged to suit.\nI charge a small fee for my time, but the healing is free. Payments can be arranged to suit income.\nThese are distant healing sessions so would be arranged by phone or video call. \nA Healing session just requires that you have a quiet, undisturbed space, and you are sitting comfortably or laying down, resting. \nI will make notes at the start, guide you to relax, and help to bring you back afterwards. \nHealing cannot promise a cure, it often goes where it needs to, you may feel a cold or hot tingling sensation, and it can help to alleviate suffering. \n\nThank You\n\nSelva')

You can find it at: \n\nüíéüåühttps://www.etsy.com/listing/1016822709/ocean-seascape-soap-handcrafted-soap?ref=shop_home_feat_1\n\nYou can choose from a variety of beachy ocean inspired premium fragrances \u2028or a few select and delicious high quality essential oils.\n\nThe sand at the bottom of the Ocean Seascape soap is made with a small amount of natural walnut shell powder to give it a true sand and sea look. The walnut shell serves as a gentle exfoliant for your face and body leaving your skin soft, smooth and polished.\n\u2028\nWe add a small amount of cosmetic grade skin safe glitter to the translucent ocean water and the top layer to make it sparkle and shimmer like true ocean water.\n\nWe can ship the loaf of soap uncut wrapped in cellophane or we can slice the soap for you into 8 individual pieces and shrink wrap it.\n\n*Each bar of soap is cut by hand and varies slightly in weight and size. All of the Ocean Seascape soap bars are unique and one of a kind, you will never get the same design again. The design of each bar will also vary slightly from one bar to another because they are hand poured custom made designs that create their own special effects and swirls each time a new loaf of soap is created. However, you will always get a gorgeous piece of soap.\n\n*NOTE: Please use proper safety precautions when cutting soap. The easiest and safest way is to use a soap loaf cutter that you can purchase online. If you are using a kitchen knife it&#39;s best if it is sharp and non stick. Also, use a kitchen towel or a nonslip cutting board to make sure the soap does not slip while you are slicing it. \n\nOption 1:\n\nüíéüåüQuantity: One Premium Soap Loaf \n\nüíéüåüWeight: Approximately 3lbs\n\nüíéüåüSize: Approximately 10&quot; Length x 2¬Ω&quot; Width x 3&quot; Height\n\nOption 2: \n\nüíéüåüQuantity: 8 Soap Bars\n\nüíéüåüWeight: Between 6.5 oz to 7 oz each\n\nüíéüåüSize: 3¬Ω&quot; x 2¬Ω&quot; x 1¬º&quot;\n\nüíéüåüColors: White, Ocean Blue‚Äôs & Sandy\n\nüíéüåü\u2028Scent: Custom (EO = Essential Oil) and (FO = Fragrance Oil)\n\nüíéüåüType Of Soap: Glycerin\n\nGlycerin Soap Skin Benefits: Glycerin is found in many moisturizing skin care products and soaps.

Due to the intricate details of my designs, there may be a small chance that the vinyl may peel on very small pieces. Applying heat from a hair dryer may help re-stick the vinyl, or the tiniest bit of clear nail polish will stick down the vinyl easily.\n\nPLEASE READ\nThese items are made to order so please give some time for them to be completed.

You can upgrade this to First Class or Special Delivery when ordering. If the option to this isn&#39;t showing, please contact us to arrange this. \n\nEverywhere Else: We send all international orders via the Royalmail&#39;s Tracked and Signed Service (we send items just &#39;Tracked&#39; if &#39;Tracked and Signed&#39; service is not available in your region). The typical delivery time is 5-10 working days, however if your package gets held up at customs it could take over 30 days to arrive. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do to prevent or expedite packages that are delayed. \n\nRETURNS:\nWe accept returns up to 28 days after purchase.

Designed to keep your cats coat shiny and healthy. It&#39;s great at helping manage and prevent matted fur and helps reduce cat hairballs. \n\nEvery BrushPod also contains a pair of soft touch claw clippers, a three-in-one laser toy (laser, torch and UV light) and a full canister of catnip. We hand assemble and package each one from our little studio in Henley on Thames. A fantastic Christmas gift for any cat lover! \n\nThe BrushPod&#39;s party piece is our four uniquely designed micro-meshes in the brush head. These &#39;breathable&#39; tiny holes near the bristles allow the catnip scent to attract your cat - meaning even the most brush shy cat likes to get involved! And don&#39;t worry the holes are so small no catnip gets on you or your cats fur. \n\nThe claw clippers are stainless steel and super strong, and the laser toy has a built in USB charger. The canister of catnip is full to the brim with our organically sourced mix of catnip and matatabi which we fill by hand before shipping to you.  \n\nWe&#39;ve designed every element of the BrushPod from the ground up and is exclusive to us here at Kuba & Leia. With the exception of the laser toy, everything down to our packaging is fully recyclable and we use only the best premium materials. \n\nIf you&#39;re looking for an unusual, fun and practical gift for any cat lover then this could be just the ticket! \n\nDesigned with love by the Kuba & Leia in the UK.')
